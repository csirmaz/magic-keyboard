# magic-keyboard
Arduino-based magic keyboard

If you are tired of entering the same command again and again into Minecraft on PlayStation etc., but
have an Arduino and a server with PHP and Apache, this setup turns the Arduino into a "magic" keyboard
that types automatically whatever is entered into the web UI.

Includes a system to move around a flat world to find some previously lost location.
